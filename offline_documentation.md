# Tools to search offline documentation

## Tools

* Dash - MacOS
* Zeal - Linux and windows

## Offical docsets

* [Official dash docset feeds](https://github.com/Kapeli/feeds)

## User contributed docsets

* [User contributed docsets1](http://zealusercontributions.herokuapp.com/)
* [User contributed docsets1](https://zealusercontributions.now.sh/)

Get the URL to the XML feed and add it to zeal. The docset gets added to zeal.

## Generate custom docset

Both zeal and dash work on dash docsets only. We can generate dash docset for any tool by following the [steps documented here](https://kapeli.com/docsets#python)

**NOTE**: In case a documentation for a tool is not available as part of official feeds, search in the websites mentioned under the section user contributed docsets. If the documentation can't be found there, then either generate your own documentation offline or ping [zealdocs gitter](https://gitter.im/zealdocs/) to check if any docset feed is available out there.
